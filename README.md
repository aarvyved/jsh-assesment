### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Notes:
1. The DEMO_KEY for the NASA Api's has a rate limiter. So, the user might see empty list depending on the time they are launching this app. To avoid this replase the `API_KEY` value in the /sr/api/index.js file with a custom API KEY.
